# Ghost-Hunting-Finding-a-Botnet-in-NetFlow-Traffic
Searching for malware is like hunting ghosts.  Purposefully designed to blend in with normal system traffic, the average network security officer can easily miss malware transmissions traversing his or her network amongst the vast amount of other material(Gunter, 2020).  This project is designed to determine the efficacy of machine learning classification and data modification techniques in identifying those malware transmissions.  First, we clean the data and make determinations about how to extract the maximum about of information from the available variables.  Next, we directly employ a range of classification techniques to discern which are optimized for this type of dataset.  Finally, dimension and dataset reduction techniques are employed to see how efficiently high accuracy results can be achieved.  In most cases, our efforts were successful, validating the use of many of the machine learning classification and data manipulation techniques explored for use in classifying botnet traffic.
